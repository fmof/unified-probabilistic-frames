Concrete - C++
=================

C++ headers, class files and utilities for working with [Concrete](https://github.com/hltcoe/concrete), an HLT data specification defined using [Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org).

This repository contains the C++ files generated by the Thrift compiler. 
The .thrift definition files used to generate are not included.

Requirements
------------

Concrete-cpp requires the following:

* gcc >= 4.8
* 'thrift' C++ library >= 0.9.1
* 'boost' C++ library >= 1.53.0
* '[Google Test](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/)' == 1.7.0 ([zip](https://googletest.googlecode.com/files/gtest-1.7.0.zip))
  - NOTE: This is _not_ `gtest` (a GNU wrapper around `test`).

Setup
-----
Edit the first ~15 lines of Makefile.config to point the build to the headers and compiled libraries for Thirft, Boost and Google Test.

Compilation
------------
The easiest way to compile is run `make all`. 
Run `make test` to run all unit tests, and run `make help` to get all outward-facing targets. 
Because this uses recursive Make, please run `make` from the top-level directory.

Installation
------------

coming soon

Using the code in your project
------------------------------

Coming soon. 
In the mean time, you can look in `core/test/src` and `util/test/src`.


## Notes

* Certain flags need to be passed in for thrift to know uint\d+ definitions: see this [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12934961/compiling-c-thrift-code-to-interface-cassandra-results-in-following-errors-wh) question. This was supposedly [fixed in Thrift 0.9](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-1326) but I still had to add `-DHAVE_NETINET_IN_H -DHAVE_INTTYPES_H`.
